# plant-disease-detection-project


⁉️ why this project?
---------------------
Make a deep learning model that can detect plant diseases (especially apple diseases) from images.
Early detection of plant diseases can help farmers take timely actions, reducing crop losses and promoting sustainable agriculture.
enabling users to interactively diagnose plant diseases.

🗂️ Dataset
--------------
 Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset
 Content:87.9k images

 🛠️ Preparing data
 ------------------
 Used transforms.ToTensor() for normalization 
 initialize DataLoader for efficient batch processing

🏋️Training
------------------
using:- 
CNN model : for image recognition and processing
Adam optimizer: for per-parameter adaptive learning rates
Learning Rate: that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.

🧪 Testing
-----------------
testing another images to predict diseases and get accuracy

🏃‍♂️‍➡️ run project
------------------------
run filename.py
Then  upload the image and make prediction.
